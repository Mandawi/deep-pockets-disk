      Each game additionally includes five shot in the dark riddles, which uncover the riddle each irregular letter in turn, and grant money to whoever rings in with the correct answer.

      The last round is constantly had in any event in influence in a "accelerate" design, in which the host turns the disk; every consonant in that round merits the worth at the red hopeful's bolt in addition to $1,000. In the event that this twist arrives on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, it is altered from the transmission and the host turns the disk once more. Vowels don't add or deduct cash from the challengers' scores in the accelerate round. The challenger in control calls one letter, and on the off chance that it shows up in the riddle, the contender is given three seconds to endeavor to settle. Play continues clockwise, beginning with the hopeful who was in charge at the hour of the last twist, until the riddle is settled. The three-second clock doesn't start until the lady has uncovered all cases of a called letter and moved beside the riddle load up, and the candidate may offer numerous estimates on his/her turn. After the accelerate round, the contender with the most elevated all out rewards dominates the match and advances to the reward round. Candidates who didn't settle any riddles are granted an incidental award of $1,000 (or $2,000 in weeks with two-competitor groups).
